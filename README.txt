ABOUT THE INVITATION
==========================================

The invitation features a heartfelt poetic tribute:

"From stormy exams to laughter down long halls,
Your wisdom wove the map we dare to read.
When storms would rise, and shadows dim our way,
You lit the path with hope's unyielding seed.

2025's silver dawn now gleams, a jubilee's chime,
The Class you molded soars on wings of time—
Today, we ask you to share their final flight.

Come celebrate the seeds you've sown,
And bid farewell to all the Dipsites of the Silver Legacy..."
